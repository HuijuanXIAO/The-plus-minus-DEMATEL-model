# The-plus-minus-DEMATEL-model
Compared with the traditional Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model, the plus-minus DEMATEL model can not only evaluate the overall causal influence between factors but can explore the synergy and trade-offs by opening the blackbox. The interations of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) using the proposed model, including synergy effects and trade-off effects, has been illustrated here.
