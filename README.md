# The-plus-minus-DEMATEL-model
Compared with the traditional Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model, the plus-minus DEMATEL model can not only evaluate the overall causal influence between factors but can explore the synergy and trade-offs by opening the blackbox. The data have been included in the code to ensure working without external file. The code can be applied to other cases only by changing the matrix Z in step 1.

For more details about the steps of this proposed model, a related reference is provided below. If the code or method is obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, I kindly ask you to cite them properly, as shown below:
